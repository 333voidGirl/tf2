# 333voidGirl's TF2 config

Currently just some basic cfg files and my custom hitsounds. Will work on adding any other notable files that I'm allowed to distribute and/or link to anything else I use.

## What do you use?

Hud:
I used to use [Toonhud](https://toonhud.com/user/333voidgirl/theme/QBS9ZA6G/), but I've been using [DarHud](https://gamebanana.com/mods/463048/).
