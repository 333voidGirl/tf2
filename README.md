# 333voidGirl's TF2 config
Should reproduce my exact TF2 settings (give or take things like volume, if I have chat, etc. as I change those often). Most mods I use for performance/visuals should be linked below. I run the game using Vulkan on Arch Linux x86_64. 

## Launch Options
gamemoderun %command% -precachefontchars -precachefontintlchars -no_texture_stream -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd -particles 1 -freq 165 +exec w/config.cfg

## Mods
I use [mastercomfig](https://comfig.app/) (originally the low preset). I'm also using [CleanTF2Plus](https://github.com/JarateKing/CleanTF2plus) to get rid of bullet dust, generate flat textures, etc. If you're on Linux you might have to disable the checks to see if the folder is in the right place (simply comment out the lines doing the checking and you should be fine lol). 

For reduced/no explosion smoke and crosshairs I use [cfg.tf](https://cfg.tf/tools/crosshairs/) + their spy sapper effects. You can read more [here](https://www.teamfortress.tv/25647).

[No Decals](https://gamebanana.com/mods/12385).

I have some LOD mods, although I'm not entirely sure if they help. They're [Recompilation of LODs](https://gamebanana.com/mods/4) and [Dispenser New Missing Lods](https://gamebanana.com/mods/445997).

[Fixed Viewmodels](https://gamebanana.com/mods/206440).

[Green Box Heal Target Indicator](https://gamebanana.com/mods/617250).

[Medigun Sound Fixes](https://gamebanana.com/mods/388321).

Less distracting [bleeding](https://gamebanana.com/mods/500640), [gas passer](https://gamebanana.com/mods/477373), and [jarate](https://gamebanana.com/mods/476911) as well as [Static Uber Overlay](https://gamebanana.com/mods/394677).

[No-Smoke Rocket Launcher Particles](https://gamebanana.com/mods/12418).

[ClearWater](https://gamebanana.com/mods/199840).

[Scope Overlay LOD Independence](https://gamebanana.com/mods/388222).

Sometimes [Blu Scout pants + cosmetics](https://gamebanana.com/mods/368305).

Sometimes [No-Hats-Mod bgum](https://gamebanana.com/mods/205768).

[Quake 3 Arena Hit/Killsound](https://gamebanana.com/sounds/32458).

The [Casual Particle Preloader](https://gamebanana.com/tools/19049) fixes all issues I've had with loading in mods. I use the built-in version of the [Ultimate Visual Fix Pack](https://github.com/agrastiOs/Ultimate-TF2-Visual-Fix-Pack).
