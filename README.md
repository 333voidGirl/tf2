# 333voidGirl's TF2 config
Should reproduce my exact TF2 settings. Pretty much anything I cannot directly distribute (I.E. mods) should be linked below.

## Hud
[Middle Mann](https://gamebanana.com/mods/445578), although I previously used [Toonhud](https://toonhud.com/user/333voidgirl/theme/QBS9ZA6G/) and [DarHud](https://gamebanana.com/mods/463048/).

## Animations
[Pyro](https://gamebanana.com/mods/206311),
[Soldier](https://gamebanana.com/mods/206373),
[Engineer](https://gamebanana.com/mods/400704),
[Demoman](https://gamebanana.com/mods/373379),
[Medic](https://gamebanana.com/mods/424671),
[Heavy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/351628),
[Spy](https://gamebanana.com/mods/307980),
[Scout](https://gamebanana.com/mods/206351).
Sniper animations I've tried don't seem to load for some reason.

## Other Mods
For reduced/no explosion smoke I use Electrocuted Blue Flash. You can read more and pick out your favorite effect [here](https://www.teamfortress.tv/25647).

I don't use [mastercomfig](https://comfig.app/), but I do use a couple of their mods which you can install from the "app" section--namely the "No Footsteps" and "No Soundscapes" VPKs. I have the Pyroland (map) textures disabled and flat mouse settings applied manually, although the VPKs that do the same are also available from them.

I use [Custom Pyrovision Goggles](https://gamebanana.com/mods/547776), [Rainbow Jarate](https://gamebanana.com/mods/202124), [Beep-Spenser](https://gamebanana.com/mods/448202), [Harvester](https://gamebanana.com/requests/65992), [Trickster Lollichop](https://gamebanana.com/mods/204909) [Improved Textures Bundle](https://gamebanana.com/mods/465680), [Sweeping Willow](https://gamebanana.com/mods/547671), [Cauldron Concotions](https://gamebanana.com/mods/547672), [Hammer & Sickle Gloves](https://gamebanana.com/mods/495191) and [Retexture](https://gamebanana.com/mods/294328), and [Complementary Lightwrap](https://gamebanana.com/mods/205324). Christ that's a lot more than I remembered. Some of these do not work on casual and I've not gotten around to making them compatible yet.

My hit and kill sounds are hardstyle kicks from the various Reddit Hardstyle Packs on /r/Hardstyle. They're available in this repo but I thought I should mention their origin.

[Modern Casual Preloader](https://gamebanana.com/wips/79779) keeps everything running. Goddess bless.
